# Test matrix_divided function

>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

# Test Case 1: Divide each element of the matrix by 1 (no change)
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 1))
[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

# Test Case 2: Divide each element of the matrix by 3
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

# Test Case 3: Attempt to divide by 0, should raise a ZeroDivisionError
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

# Test Case 4: Attempt to divide a matrix with different row sizes, should raise a TypeError
>>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]], 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

# Test Case 5: Attempt to divide by a string, should raise a TypeError
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 'hello'))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: div must be a number

# Test Case 6: Divide each element of the matrix by 9.99
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 9.99))
[[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]]
